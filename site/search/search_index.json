            "text": "Overview\n\n\n\n\nDefining Heroes is done on the Heroes tab of the planner. A Hero represents an entity that will be able to join the players 'group' and in doing so they will be eligible to participate in battles and progress in power through leveling up and through receiving new items. In general each Hero should be unique to the group, that is, there should not be multiple instances of the Hero in the group at a given time. As Heroes progress they may gain the option of being promoted which allows for a completely different set of attributes to be used for the hero. Each hero must contain at minimum one \nHeroProgression\n that defines their starting statistics when they join the force. At maximum a hero should have three \nHeroProgessions\n defined, one unpromoted, one promoted and one special promotion.\n\n\n\n\nLeaders\n\n\nHero's that are marked with the 'Is Leader' option represent a combatant that is so important that if they are killed in any battle then the battle is considered lost. Because of this, very few heroes should be marked as leader. However at least one hero must be defined and in the players 'group' at any given time, generally the first hero in the players 'group'. The hero that is marked as a leader that has been in the 'group' the longest time will act as the players controllable character for in-town movement and interaction. For situations where a hero may be considered a leader in a subset of the battles, you should use the \nOn Hero Death\n condition for those battles.\n\n\nFor more information about the in-town game state see: \nGame States\n\n\nFor more information about using triggers see: \nUsing Triggers and Conditions\n\n\nMovement Type\n\n\nEach hero will have a movement type that dictates how terrain effects it's movement in battle. Available values for this property are set in the implementation of the \nEngineConfigurationValues\n that you have defined via the \ngetMovementTypes\n attribute. Each moveable space in battle should be defined with one of the terrain types in your implementation of \nEngineConfigurationValues\n via the \ngetTerrainTypes\n attribute.\n\n\nFor more information about defining terrain and movement types see: \nConfiguring the Engine\n\n\nFor more information about the effects of terrain and movement types see: \nDefault Battle System\n\n\nEquippable Items\n\n\nEach hero can define a subset of equippable items that they can equip. A hero will only be allowed to equip an item if the items \nItem Style\n matches on the of the values selected in the 'Usable Items' attribute of the hero. The list of item styles is defined by your implementation of \nEngineConfigurationValues\n as defined by \ngetWeaponTypes\n. By default all heroes are allowed to wear rings.\n\n\nFor more information about defining weapon types see: \nConfiguring the Engine\n\n\nStatistic Growth\n\n\nA hero starts the game with the statistics indicated in their starting progression. \n\n\nMost statistics can naturally increase over the course of the game when a hero levels up: \n\n\nThe first set of these are \nHP\n, \nMP\n, \nAttack\n, \nDefense\n and \nAgility\n statistics. For these five statistics the hero will start with the value indicated by their starting progressions \nHP Start\n, \nMP Start\n, \nAttack Start\n, \nDefense Start\n and \nAgility Start\n values respectively. As the hero gains levels their statistics should approach the values indicated by the \nHP End\n, \nMP End\n, \nAttack End\n, \nDefense End\n and \nAgility End\n attributes. The speed in which these statistics grow is determine by each of the respective \nATTRIBUTE Gain\n category. The values available in this list are defined in your implementation of \nLevelProgressionConfiguration\n via the \ngetStandardStatProgressionTypeList\n attribute. Each time a hero gains a level, the defined \nLevelProgressionConfiguration\n will have its' \ngetProgressArray\n method called which will indicate the percent of the way towards the final statistic value (\nATTRIBUTE End\n) the given attribute should be at with that attributes \nGain\n rate and their current level.\n\n\nThe next set of values that may grow as you gain levels are \nBody\n and \nMind\n, their initial values are indicated by a selection of 'WEAK', 'MEDIUM' or 'STRONG'. These values map to percentages as defined by your implementation of \nLevelProgressionConfiguration\n via the \ngetBaseBodyMindStat\n method. These values grow at a rate as defined by their respective \nProgression Type\n. The available \nProgression Types\n are defined by your implementation of \nLevelProgressionConfiguration\n via the \ngetBodyMindProgressionTypeList\n method. Each time a hero gains a level, the defined \nLevelProgressionConfiguration\n will have its' \ngetLevelUpBodyMindStat\n method called which will indicate the value that the \nBody\n or \nMind\n statistic should be set to given the hero's current level and \nProgression Type\n \n\n\nFinally, although the Special Attack statistics do not specify a growth rate they can also grow as the hero levels, their initial values are indicated by a selection of 'WEAK', 'MEDIUM' or 'STRONG'. These values map to percentages as defined by your implementation of \nLevelProgressionConfiguration\n via the \ngetBaseBattleStat\n method. The growth of these values is defined by \nLevelProgressionConfiguration\n via the \ngetLevelUpBattleStat\n method which is called each time a hero gains a level.\n\n\nFor more information about defining statistic growth see: \nConfiguring the Engine\n\n\nSpecial Attack Chances\n\n\nEach time a hero uses a basic attack or is attacked with a basic attack there is a chance that they will perform a special beneficial action. \n\n\n\n\nCounter: The target of attack will perform a single attack action against their attacker provided that they are in range. This attack deals damage equal to the damage they would have normally done times the value defined in the \nBattleFunctionConfiguration\n by the \ngetCounterDamageModifier\n.\n\n\nEvade: The target of the basic attack will take no damage or effects from the a single attack. The defendants \"Dodge\" animation will be shown.\n\n\nDouble: The attacker will perform two full damage attacks back-to-back against it's target.\n\n\nCritical: The attacker will deal increased damage with their basic attack, the amount dealt is equal to the damage they would have normally done times the value defined in the \nBattleFunctionConfiguration\n by the \ngetCritDamageModifier\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe value specified in this field should be a number 0-100 that indicates the percent chance that the hero will perform the given special action. For instance a value of \"20\" in the 'Double Chance Strength' field means that each time the hero performs a basic attack they will have a 20% to perform a double attack.\n\n\nEach of these percent values may be further modified in the \nBattleFunctionConfiguration\n via the \ngetDoublePercent\n, \ngetCounterPercent\n, \ngetDodgePercent\n, \ngetCritPercent\n attributes which allows for adding custom values that can be used to increase/decrease battle difficulty.\n\n\nFor more information about defining special attack chances and outcomes see: \nConfiguring the Engine\n\n\nSpell Progression\n\n\nHero's can be defined to begin the game with spells also to learn new spells and spell levels as they progress. A defined \nSpellProgression\n is directly tied to a \nHeroProgression\n by the combination of values indicated by \nPromoted Progression\n and \nSpecial Promoted Progression\n. A hero that is currently unpromoted will be progressing via the \nHeroProgression\n that has the \nPromoted Progression\n box unchecked, similarly their spells will be progressing at a rate as defined by \nSpellProgressions\n that have the \nPromoted Progression\n box unchecked. Once the hero becomes promoted then they will be progressing via the \nHeroProgression\n that has the \nPromoted Progression\n box checked, similarly their spells will be progressing at a rate as defined by \nSpellProgressions\n that have the \nPromoted Progression\n box checked.\n\n\nFor example: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nConsider the hero with four spell progressions defined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the hero was unpromoted and level 1 they would know Lightning level 1 and Flood level 2. They would eventually be able to attain Lightning 2-4 and Flood level 3 at higher levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the hero was promoted and level 1, but not special promoted they would know Bolt level 2. They would eventually be able to attain Bolt 3-4 at higher levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the hero was special promoted and level 1 they would know Blaze level 3. They would gain no more spells as they continued to level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpells may be defined with up to four levels, so \nSpellProgressions\n may also indicate four numbers in the \nLevels Gained\n attribute with each number indicating which level the hero will gain the next level of the spell.\n\n\nFor example: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nLevels Gained\n text field contains four numbers which means this hero can learn Lightning levels 1-4. Because the \nPromoted Progression\n box is checked and the first number indicated is '1', Lightning level 1 will be learned as soon as the hero is promoted or if the hero is defined as promoted to start. Because the next number is '7', the hero will learn Lightning level 2 once they reach promoted level 7. Lightning level 3 will be learned at level 12 and Lightning level 4 will be learned at level 18. If the first two numbers were \"1\" (So 1,1,12,18), then the hero would learn Lightning level 1 and 2 when they are promoted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor more information about defining spells see: \nConfiguring the Engine\n\n\nStarting Items\n\n\nHeroes can join the 'group' with equipment and other items. The list of items available to give to a hero is the same as the list of items defined in the planner. Keep in mind when adding equipped items to a hero that it could modify the final statistics of the hero when it is in battle. \n\n\nTo give an hero a starting item, right click on their name in the planner and select \"Starting Item\".\n\n\nPromotion\n\n\nDepending on how you have configured your engine, heroes can become eligible for promotion by reaching the level specified in your implementation of \nEngineConfigurationValues\n via the \ngetHeroPromotionLevel\n attribute. Promotion represents an opportunity to change all aspects of a hero's progression including statistic progression, access to spells, movement type and usable item types. On attaining promotion level an unpromoted hero can be promoted by speaking with a priest and selecting the Promote option. Hero's must have a promotion progression defined in order to be promoted, otherwise errors will occur. A hero can be defined as promoted to begin with by checking the 'Promoted' box, in this case the hero will use the 'HeroProgession' that has the 'Promoted Progression' box checked. Hero's that join the group already promoted cannot ever use a Special Promotion.\n\n\nUpon promotion changes occur in the following areas.\n\n\nBasic Statistics (By default: HP, MP, Attack, Defense, Agility) \n\n\nNone of the hero's basic statistics will be immediately changed, that means that a hero may have a statistic lower then the indicated 'Start' value, but on subsequent level ups, statistic progression will be done using the promoted progressions 'Start' and 'End' values which will likely result in a different growth then the unpromoted progression. \n\n\n Level \n\n\nThe hero's level will be changed to a value of \"1\". All level specific attributes (spell progression) should use this new lower number to define progression timing.\n\n\n Movement Value and Movement Type \n\n\nThe hero's base movement statistic and their movement type will immediately be changed to the value specified in the promoted progression.\n\n\n Resistances \n\n\nThe hero's base elemental resistances will immediately be changed to the the value specified in the promoted progression.\n\n\n Special Attack Chance (By default: Double, Counter, Dodge, Critical) \n\n\nThe hero's special attack chances will immediately be changed to the value specified in the promoted progression.\n\n\n Spells \n\n\nAll of the hero's spells learned before promotion will be immediately forgotten. Any \nSpellProgressions\n that are defined for the hero that are marked as promoted will be checked to see if the hero meets the level requirements for the indicated spell and if so, they will learn that spell immediately. For any spell that the hero previously knew that they should retain after promotion a \nSpellProgression\n should be defined with the \nPromoted Progression\n box checked and the \nLevels Gained\n set as \"1\" so that they immediately gain the spell.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n \n\n\nJoe is unpromoted and level 14 with the following \nSpellProgression's\n defined:\n\n\n\n\nBecause of this he knows Flood level 2.\n\n\nAfter he becomes promoted he becomes level 1 and has only the following \nSpellProgression\n defined that is marked as \nPromoted Progression\n\n\n\n\nBecause he has forgotten his original spells this means that he only has access to Burst level 1\n\n\nIf we wanted him to continue having access to Flood level 2 then we would need to add an additional \nSpellProgression\n marked \nPromoted Progression\n that defines the levels that he learns Flood level 2. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Usable Items and Inventory\n\n\nA promoted hero will immediately lose proficiency with the items specified in their unpromoted progression and will become proficient in the items specified as \nUsable Items\n in the promoted progression. The items in the hero's inventory will remain unchanged, but depending upon their newly defined \nUsable Items\n they may no longer have a given item equipped if they are no longer able to use it.\n\n\nFor more information about in game statistics see: \nDefault Battle System\n\n\nFor more information about defining promotion level see: \nConfiguring the Engine\n\n\nSpecial Promotion\n\n\nSpecial promotion is very similar to promotion as defined above except that a \nHeroProgression\n that is marked as 'Special Promoted Progression' can only be attained when the hero to be promoted is holding the indicated 'Special Promotion Required Item' in their inventory. The list of items to allow special promotion is the same as the list of items defined in the planner. When this occurs the Priest will prompt the user to see if they want to use the indicated item to promote the hero to this special promotion. If yes is selected then the item will be removed from the hero's inventory and the hero's progression will now follow the special progression. This is identical as far as changes are concerned to a normal promotion except that the hero's spell progression will now be drawn from \nSpellProgression's\n that have the \nSpecial Promotion Progression\n box selected.\n\n\nFor more information about creating items see: \nDefining Items\n\n\nPlanner Attributes\n\n\nDefault Values\n\n\n\n\nName: The name of the hero\n\n\nPromoted: If true, this hero is promoted when they initially join the party\n\n\nLevel: Starting Level for the hero\n\n\nAnimation File: The name of the animation file that should be used for this hero\n\n\nIs Leader: Whether this hero is the leader of the force\n\n\n\n\nHero Progression: This heroes statistic progression\n\n\n\n\nPromoted Progression: Whether this progression represents this heroes promoted or unpromoted progression\n\n\nSpecial Promotion Progression: If checked, this progression will be used for the SPECIAL promotion path (as opposed to default). Selecting this supercedes the 'promoted' checkbox\n\n\nSpecial Promotion Required Item: If special promotion is checked, this is the item that must be possesed by the group to allow the this special promotion to occur. If this item is not owned then this progression path will be unavailable. If special promotion is checked and this value is not specified then this promotion path will be impossible to take.\n\n\nStarting Move: The heroes base move while in this progression\n\n\nMovement Type: The movement type of this hero\n\n\nAttack Gain: The amount of attack the hero should gain per level\n\n\nAttack Start: The amount of attack the hero should start with\n\n\nAttack End: The minimum amount of attack the hero should end with\n\n\nDefense Gain: The amount of defense the hero should gain per level\n\n\nDefense Start: The amount of defense the hero should start with\n\n\nDefense End: The minimum amount of defense the hero should end with\n\n\nSpeed Gain: The amount of speed the hero should gain per level\n\n\nSpeed Start: The amount of speed the hero should start with\n\n\nSpeed End: The minimum amount of speed the hero should end with\n\n\nHP Gain: The amount of HP the hero should gain per level\n\n\nHP Start: The amount of HP the hero should start with\n\n\nHP End: The minimum amount of HP the hero should end with\n\n\nMP Gain: The amount of MP the hero should gain per level\n\n\nMP Start: The amount of MP the hero should start with\n\n\nMP End: The minimum amount of MP the hero should end with\n\n\nFire Affinitiy: The heroes base fire affinity.

Once the hero becomes promoted then they will be progressing via the  HeroProgression  that has the  Promoted Progression  box checked, similarly their spells will be progressing at a rate as defined by  SpellProgressions  that have the  Promoted Progression  box checked.  For example:     Consider the hero with four spell progressions defined        If the hero was unpromoted and level 1 they would know Lightning level 1 and Flood level 2. They would eventually be able to attain Lightning 2-4 and Flood level 3 at higher levels.    If the hero was promoted and level 1, but not special promoted they would know Bolt level 2. They would eventually be able to attain Bolt 3-4 at higher levels.    If the hero was special promoted and level 1 they would know Blaze level 3.

Spells may be defined with up to four levels, so  SpellProgressions  may also indicate four numbers in the  Levels Gained  attribute with each number indicating which level the hero will gain the next level of the spell.  For example:      The  Levels Gained  text field contains four numbers which means this hero can learn Lightning levels 1-4. Because the  Promoted Progression  box is checked and the first number indicated is '1', Lightning level 1 will be learned as soon as the hero is promoted or if the hero is defined as promoted to start. Because the next number is '7', the hero will learn Lightning level 2 once they reach promoted level 7.

Level   The hero's level will be changed to a value of \"1\". All level specific attributes (spell progression) should use this new lower number to define progression timing.

Evade: The target of the basic attack will take no damage or effects from the a single attack. The defendants \"Dodge\" animation will be shown.  Double: The attacker will perform two full damage attacks back-to-back against it's target.
