Cinematic sprite render effects, move to separate files and allow custom ones?
Handle custom cinematic events, would be pretty slick to bundle cinematic definition, parsing and execution in a class
Change animation configuration to be in the EngineConfig and make methods non static... what about games not wanting promotion?
